    <!-- Main About -->

    <!-- I'm just gonna copy paste my about from my actual website (kovidbhaduri.com) although it's a bit outdated. -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row" style="margin: 2%;">
            <h1 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">The story, in short.</h1> <br>
            <p> I was born in Kolkata to an engineer and a homemaker. Due to my father’s transferrable job and love for travel, I lived and traveled extensively across India. After a better-than-average high school performance, I was lined up for college and a stable, if long, working career. 
                
                <br><br>That is where we diverge from the dogma. <br><br>
                
                My father and brother, convinced me to try out alternative education. Having both seen a lot of what the traditional schooling/working path had to offer, I had good reason to heed their advice. And so I did. <br><br>
                
                Post high school I joined a US project-based learning BootCamp called <a href="https://discoverpraxis.com/">Praxis</a>, where I learned fundamental business skills, and extremely valuable lessons on how to work for startups. My work their saw me creating a few very interesting projects, that formed the basis of what became my “degree”. (You can check out one of my projects <a href="https://kovidbhaduri.medium.com/30-days-to-write-and-sell-a-book-the-landing-page-b51f9ba2d5b5">here</a>!)
                
                <br><br>After Graduating from Praxis I joined a <a href="https://www.adrianoplegroup.com/">Special Economic Zones research company</a> as a research consultant, and was later promoted to their partnerships manager. Through my work their I got to interact with a lot of people in a lot of very interesting industries, and with international organizations of significance (World Bank, United Nations, and a few others). I also consulted for startups and investors in highly diversified fields (high-end medical technology, city running software, and large scale finance corporations to name a few). In my work there I performed due diligence for SEZ investors, as well as some business development and marketing consulting.
                
                <br><br>I have since become highly interested in the future of learning. Specifically, my interest lies in the alternative education space. I now work as a marketing contractor for education media company <a href="https://rebeleducator.co/">rebelEducator</a>, under one of my original mentors back in Praxis. At rE we are trying to build a one-stop, all-encompassing resource hub for parents considering alternative education for their children. You can check out some of our work on our <a href="https://rebeleducator.co/">blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rebelEducator">Twitter page</a>, and <a href="https://substack.com/profile/48078166-rebeleducator">substack</a>. I also explore this industry in some personal capacity, by teaching in volunteering missions across the world and by consuming media covering the space. I seek to be more involved in teaching kids in the months to come.
                
                That’s my life so far in a nutshell. If you’d like to connect with me on social, you can go <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kovid-bhaduri-1097591b7/">formal</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/akovidbhaduri/">informal</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/KovidBhaduri">controversial</a>,or <a href="https://chickenonaraft.com/">just spend some time with a chicken</a>. Admittedly, the fourth doesn’t help your case much, but hey, who doesn’t like spending some time with a chicken?</p>
